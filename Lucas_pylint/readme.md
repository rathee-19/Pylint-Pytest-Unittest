Initial Version (Lucas1.py)
At first, the code in Lucas1.py had some issues pointed out by pylint. It was missing some explanations about what the code did (like a guidebook), and it used words in the wrong way. Also, there was a part that could be simpler.

Final Version (Lucas1.py)
After fixing those problems and changing the name of the file to follow the snake_case naming the code got a perfect score! It added explanations where needed, made sure the words were used correctly, and simplified a part. Now it's super clear and neat. Great job!
