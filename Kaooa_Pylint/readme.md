Initial Version (Lucas1.py)
In the beginning, the file called Lucas1.py had lots of mistakes found by a tool called pylint. These mistakes included things like wrong spacing, lines being too long, and using words in the wrong way.

Final Version (Lucas7.py)
After making changes, the file called Lucas7.py fixed many of those mistakes. It got rid of extra words, made sure lines weren't too long, and used the right words in the right places. However, there are still some things that could be better. Overall, though, it's much cleaner and easier to understand than before.
