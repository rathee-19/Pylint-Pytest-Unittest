What does this code do?
This code helps find palindrome dates for a given year. A palindrome date is a date where the day and month are the same way derived from the year for example 2003-> 30 02 2003

How does it work?
You input a year.
The code checks different combinations of the year's digits to find a valid date.
If it finds a palindrome date, it shows you the date in the format "DD MM YYYY".
If it doesn't find a valid date, it tells you it's invalid.

How to use it:
Run the code.
Input the year you want to check for palindrome dates.

How to test it:
Make sure you have Python and pytest installed.
Run the test file (test.py).
It will check if the code works correctly with different input scenarios.
